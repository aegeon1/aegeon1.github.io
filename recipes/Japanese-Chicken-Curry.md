# Ingredients

- 2 tablespoon oil
- 2 onions (Indonesian: bawang bombay), peeled and thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic (Indonesian: bawang putih), grated
- 1 inch ginger (Indonesian: jahe), peeled and grated
- 500 gram skinless boneless chicken breast (Indonesian: dada ayam), cut into cubes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside for 10 minutes
- 2 carrots (Indonesian: wortel), peeled and cut into bite sizes
- 1 liter (4 cups) water or chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon honey (Indonesian: madu)
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 Fuji apple, peeled, cored, and grated (optional, but really great if you can find this apple)
- 2 potatoes, peeled and cut into bite sizes, soaked in cold water to remove starch
- 1 batch of home made curry roux (or 200 gram store bought)
- 2 tablespoon tomato sauce
- 1½ tablespoon soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a pot and stir fry onions until translucent.
2. Add garlic and ginger, mix well.
3. Add chicken breasts into the pan and cook until no longer pink.
4. Add carrot and mix well.
5. Pour water or stock into the pot and bring to a boil. Skim off scum as needed.
6. Add honey, salt, sugar, and grated Fuji apple. Simmer for 20 minutes.
7. If you are making home made curry roux, this is a good time to start cooking the roux.
8. Add potatoes and simmer for another 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
9. Add some of the soup to the sauce pan containing the home made curry roux,
stir until fully dissolve, then pour into the pot with chicken and stir
until well combined and the sauce thickens from the addition of curry
roux.
10. Add tomato sauce and soy sauce and stir until well combined. Adjust salt and sugar as needed.
11. Turn off heat and serve hot with steamed white rice.
