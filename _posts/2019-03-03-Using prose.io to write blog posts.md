## Prose.io blog post

Okay, let's see how i can post a blog post in the web browser via this prose.io webapp.

- So far it seems quite reasonable. It has a direct interface / access to Github once you grant it acess to your repositories. 

- Also, you can create a new post in the webapp and it will create a file for your through it.

- Additionally, it seems to be able to do Markdown and in fact it has some decription of the markdown format.

- It seems to be able to do images, which i will test later.


I think i can see myself using this for longer posts. Perhaps i will also use shorter posts in twitter, etc.

Great
