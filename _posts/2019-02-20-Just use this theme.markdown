Okay, there are lots of themes, but they are tricky to use, as some
jekyll gems are out of date and break the sites

There are other peoples projects you can fork , however , they tend
to have complex html code and hard to modify.

So f*** it, just use the default minima theme and when i have free
time I'll try to modify it, for now i'll just focus on blogging or
what have you.

Cheers,

PG
